This paper presents GeoSMIE, an innovative framework for document-level event extraction, tailored to extract spatial morphological information (SMI) from geological texts. By leveraging dual graph neural networks to handle complex contextual interactions and employing a no-trigger-word strategy to capture implicit SMI, GeoSMIE addresses challenges like scattered arguments and long-distance dependencies within geological documents. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models, offering a scalable and effective solution for geoscience text mining, with potential applications in geological modeling, resource exploration, and disaster assessment.
