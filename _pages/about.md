Hi, I'm Zijing Wan, a senior student majoring in Statistics and Data Science at University of California, Santa Barbara. I’m passionate about applying data science to solve real-world problems, particularly in the areas of disaster management and remote sensing. Throughout my academic journey, I’ve worked on projects like satellite-derived damage assessments, where I used machine learning models like Vision Transformers and diffusion models to enhance building damage classification and generate high-resolution disaster scene reconstructions. By leveraging these cutting-edge technologies, I aim to improve disaster response and preparedness through more accurate and timely data insights.

During my internships and research, I’ve developed strong skills in Python, data analysis, and machine learning. I'm also fascinated by the intersection of technology and societal impact, striving to improve global disaster preparedness through innovative data-driven solutions.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I’m passionate about K-pop dancing, traveling, and cooking. I love discovering new places, trying out different cuisines, and dancing to my favorite K-pop songs. Whether it’s exploring a new destination or experimenting with a recipe in the kitchen, I’m always looking for ways to enjoy life’s simple pleasures.

I'm excited about what the future holds and eager to contribute my skills to meaningful programs and projects that make a difference!
