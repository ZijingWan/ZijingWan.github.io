title: "Project2: üçîFood Recognition and Calorie Estimation"
excerpt: "This project developed a deep learning-based system using TensorFlow and Keras to improve food recognition and calorie estimation from images. By optimizing CNNs for precise food classification and creating a custom NLP model to impute nutritional data, we successfully built an end-to-end solution for real-time calorie estimation. The project utilized large-scale datasets, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy, aiming to support dietary tracking applications.
