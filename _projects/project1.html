title: "üçî Food Recognition and Calorie Estimation"
excerpt: "<p>This project developed a deep learning-based system using TensorFlow and Keras to improve food recognition and calorie estimation from images. By optimizing CNNs for precise food classification and creating a custom NLP model to impute nutritional data, we successfully built an end-to-end solution for real-time calorie estimation. The project utilized large-scale datasets, data preprocessing, and hyperparameter tuning to enhance model accuracy, aiming to support dietary tracking applications.</p>

        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>NutriAI is a project designed to leverage deep learning for food recognition and calorie estimation. It comprises a food classification model and a mobile-friendly web application, allowing users to easily identify different types of food and estimate their caloric content. The system aims to promote better eating habits by providing users with accurate nutritional information about the food they consume.</p>
        <p>The project is divided into two main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>NutriAI Model</strong>: A deep learning-based model trained to classify various food items and estimate their calorie content.</li>
            <li><strong>NutriAI App</strong>: A user-friendly web application that integrates the NutriAI model to provide real-time food recognition and calorie estimation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Key Features</h2>
        <h3>1. Food Recognition and Classification</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Utilized <strong>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)</strong> for training a robust model capable of recognizing over 100 different types of food.</li>
            <li>Applied <strong>transfer learning</strong> with pretrained models (e.g., ResNet) to achieve high accuracy with limited training data.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Calorie Estimation</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a system for estimating calories based on the identified food type and portion size.</li>
            <li>Integrated an algorithm that matches food images with nutritional databases to provide precise calorie information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Mobile-Friendly Application</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Created a <strong>React-based web application</strong> that allows users to take pictures of their meals using their mobile devices.</li>
            <li>Built a backend using <strong>Flask</strong> to connect the app to the trained NutriAI model, enabling real-time processing and feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. User Engagement and Tracking</h3>
        <ul>
